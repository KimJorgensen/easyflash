Beginning with version 1.5.0, EasyProg has a fast loader implemented
for 1541, 1571 in 1541 mode, 1581 and sd2iec/uIEC.

The fast loader for sd2iec/uIEC works only if the sd2iec/uIEC
has the right firmware running. The first officially released
firmware which supports this loader will probably be 1.0.0.

If the fast loader does not work with your drive, you can disable
it with "Options" => "Fast loader enabled: No".
