This document describes how to build EasyTransfer from source.

Linux and similar systems
=========================

1. install libwxgtk2.8-dev or whatever name it has on your system. This will
   hopefully also install all other dependencies like libwxbase2.8-dev
   install libftdi-dev and libusb-dev

2. compile it (as normal user) using these commands:

   make

   If you need the command line tool only, you can use:

   make ef3xfer

3. NOT WORKING YET: install it (optional, as root) using this command:

   sudo make install

Step 3 should even create a menu entry for Gnome, KDE or Xfce.

Windows
=======

If you got a binary, just click on it one or two times.

Mac OS X
========

Should work similar as a Linux build.

Other platforms
===============

It may be possible to compile EasyTransfer on other platforms. The most
important precondition is that wxWidgets runs on that box. You can check
it on following page: http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Supported_Platforms

If you get it running somewhere else, I appreciate a report :)
